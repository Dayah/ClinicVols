					<p>As a Clinic Vol, members are required to volunteer one hour a week at one of our several elementary schools. The primary 
					duty of the volunteer is to provide first aid and care to students that enter the clinic. All volunteers are certified in 
					first aid through the Red Cross. Members are also now required to participate in one Community Outreach program a semester.

					<p>There is a one time $20 fee that includes the training sessions and a sweet t-shirt that you see all over campus. Other 
					benefits include a $100 scholarship to any of Kaplan Test Prep and Admissions classes, volunteer hours to build a motivated 
					resume, and rights to claim "Clinic Vols" as an extracurricular activity.
		
					<p>
					As a public health service organizations we want to let Knoxville know we really care about our community and want to 
					promote public health. This organization is perhaps the most rewarding organization offered at UT, so we almost never 
					deny acceptance into our organization. However, this is a very serious organization, because the schools and nurses count 
					on us to be there. Please understand there is zero tolerance of missing the requested volunteer hour without the knowledge 
					of the chairman. We hope that you enjoy our organization during your tenure at UT!
