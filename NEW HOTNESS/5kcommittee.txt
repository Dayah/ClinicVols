|Alexis Hamilton|||I'm a junior at the University of Tennessee, majoring in Nutrition, and open to suggestions about what I should do with my life. I am currently reading eleven different books because I didn't know which one to start first. I hate making my bed, but I clean and do laundry when I'm stressed. I am terribly afraid of snakes, but not of calories.
